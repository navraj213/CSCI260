2. Store to a variable (A)
3. Capture the interest rate you want to earn (B)
4. Establish a variable to calculate/store the annual total (C)
5. Establish a variable to store running total (D)
6. Create an empty Stack data structure (TheStack)
7. Create a loop that will loop through 30 cycles for each year
8. Calculate the value of A * B and set it equal to C
9. Store C to the Stack
10. Add C to D
11. Loop until all 30 values are stored
12. Display Stack values
13. Display Total Value D
